 [*vNext*](https://github.com/sketch7/FluentlyHttpClient/compare/0.1.0...1.1.0) (201X-X-X)

### Features

- **request builder:** implement `WithItem` which allows to set custom items that can be used to share data within the scope of request, response, and middleware.
- **request builder:** add `WithUserAgent` extension

- **header builder:** extract interface `IFluentHttpHeaderBuilder`, which both `FluentHttpClientBuilder` and `FluentHttpRequestBuilder` implements.
This is done to be able to share implementations for extensions methods across `FluentHttpClientBuilder` and `FluentHttpRequestBuilder`

- **http client builder:** formatter JSON is now configured with camelcase property names by default.

 - `FluentHttpClientBuilder.UseMiddleware` is now constrained with `IFluentHttpMiddleware`.
 - `FluentHttpRequest.Url` has been renamed to `FluentHttpRequest.Uri`.
 - `FluentHttpRequest` rename `RawRequest` to `Message`
 - `FluentHttpResponse` rename `RawResponse` to `Message`

### Features

- **http client factory:** validate options on `Add`, in order to have better errors.
- **http client factory:** add default options to reduce the amount of config required (when not specified).
- **http client factory:** `Add` now returns newly created `FluentHttpClient`.
- **http client factory:** implement `WithRequestBuilderDefaults` additional hook in order customize `FluentHttpRequestBuilder` on creation.
- **http client factory:** implement `WithMessageHandler` in order to replace the HTTP stack for the HTTP client.

- **http client:** implement `Patch` and `Delete` methods.
- **http client:** extract interface `IFluentHttpClient` from `FluentHttpClient`.


### BREAKING CHANGES
- `IFluentHttpResponse` has been removed and added `FluentHttpResponse` instead. In addition, most of `FluentHttpResponse<T>` method has been changed with `FluentHttpResponse`.
Most of the changes should only effect the internals, apart from middlewares.
- Now requests created by `FluentHttpRequestBuilder` won't throw unless specified when request is not succeeded.
- `FluentHttpClientFactory.Add` now returns the new `FluentHttpClient` instance instead of `FluentHttpClientFactory`.
- `FluentHttpClientBuilder` methods naming alignment
